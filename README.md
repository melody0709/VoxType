## Highlights

- **Press and Speak** — Default CapsLock long-press to record, release to auto-paste to current window; short press toggles Caps Lock normally
- **Local-first** — C++ directly calls sherpa-onnx without Python; optional cloud ASR / LLM providers can be enabled explicitly
- **Real-time HUD** — Bottom floating capsule window during recording, 5 volume bars responding to sound
- **Dual VAD Options** — Silero VAD (lightweight) / FireRed VAD (high precision F1 97.57), intelligently skips silence
- **LLM Correction (Optional)** — Supports DeepSeek / OpenRouter / SiliconFlow and other providers, one-click configuration
- **Cloud ASR (Optional)** — Supports Volcano Engine (Doubao), Baidu Cloud, Qwen ASR (legacy `qwen3-asr-flash-realtime`, Audio 3 HTTP `qwen-audio-3.0-asr-flash`, and Audio 3 streaming `qwen-audio-3.0-asr-flash-streaming`), Xiaomi MiMo ASR (`mimo-v2.5-asr`), experimental Doubao IME ASR, and reverse-engineered Qianwen IME (`qwen_free`, requires local Qianwen IME install) as alternative backends, with optional fallback ASR

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Models

```powershell
.\download_models.ps1
```

Interactive menu for model selection, auto-downloads and extracts to `models/` directory (~3GB disk space).

> Silero VAD and FireRed VAD are built-in, no download needed.

### 2. Build

```powershell
.\build.bat
```

Requires Visual Studio 2022 (C++ desktop development workload).

To run the offline protocol/request regression tests (Qwen and shared cloud-ASR
JSON/protocol handling, LLM request/response policy, and diagnostic
WAV/metrics/privacy/retention; no network or microphone required):

```powershell
.\build.bat --test
```

### 3. Run

```powershell
.\build\run\x64-release\VoxType.exe
```

Right-click the tray icon to open Settings, hold the hotkey to start recording, release to recognize and paste.

### 4. Package for distribution

```powershell
.\build.bat --package
```

This creates verified assets under `build\packages`: a Portable `.7z` and an
x64 per-machine MSI. Both originate from the same canonical runtime payload;
the packager re-extracts and hashes each result before publishing it.

- The MSI defaults to `Program Files\VoxType`. Choose **Advanced...** during
  setup to select another directory. That selection is retained by later MSI
  upgrades.
- Installed builds store `config.json`, downloaded ASR/punctuation models, and
  logs in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VoxType`, so upgrades do not write into Program
  Files or remove user data.
- Portable builds include `portable.flag` and keep those files beside the
  extracted executable instead.
- Packages without a configured release certificate are deliberately named
  `-unsigned`; `--require-signing` refuses to publish without the signing
  environment variables documented in `packaging/windows/UPGRADE_CONTRACT.md`.

<summary><strong>Settings Guide</strong></summary>

**General & Input tab**
- `Hold hotkey` — Click the input box then press the hotkey to record
  - `Esc` cancels this recording, `Backspace/Delete` clears the hotkey
  - Default CapsLock: Short press toggles Caps Lock, long press 300ms triggers voice input
  - The recording hotkey stays active while Settings is open (press it to try it out); it is suspended only while this input box holds focus
- `Partial result` — Live typewriter preview while speaking; applies to every streaming backend (Local, Qwen, Volcano Engine, Doubao IME, Qwen IME Free)
- `Start VoxType when I sign in to Windows` registers the current user's
  Windows Run entry. It is off by default and can be safely enabled for either
  the MSI or Portable build; saving after moving a Portable folder corrects its
  stored executable path.

**Speech Engine tab**
- `ASR Backend` — Select between `Local (sherpa-onnx)`, `Volcano Engine`, `Baidu Cloud`, `Qwen ASR`, `MiMo ASR`, `Doubao IME (Free)`, and `Qwen IME (Free)`
- `Fallback` — Optional backup ASR backend: `Local`, `Baidu Cloud`, `Qwen ASR`, `MiMo ASR`, `Doubao IME (Free)`, or `Qwen IME (Free)`. If the primary backend ends in an operational failure such as timeout, network error, auth/config error, or model load error, VoxType retries the same raw PCM with the fallback backend before showing the final result. `Too short` and `No speech detected` do not trigger fallback.
- The configuration of the selected backend appears **in place** directly below these two selectors, and each provider panel keeps its own `[Test Connection]` button; credentials are never split into a separate tab.
- **Local (sherpa-onnx)** configuration:
  - `ASR model` — Speech recognition model:
    - `FireRedASR2 CTC` — Fast, suitable for daily input
    - `FireRedASR2 AED` — Better quality, more accurate for long sentences
    - `SenseVoiceSmall` — Lightweight model, suitable for low-resource machines
  - `Model folder` — Model file storage directory
  - `Threads` — Inference thread count, `auto` uses CPU core count (max 8)
  - `Punctuation` — Local offline punctuation model:
    - `Auto punctuate` — Local CT-Transformer auto-punctuation (no network required), stored as `auto`
    - `ITN only` — Inverse text normalization only, stored as `itn`
    - `Disabled` — Raw ASR text, no punctuation model loaded, stored as `none`
    - Legacy `punct` / `llm` values are shown verbatim and saved back unchanged instead of being silently rewritten.

**LLM tab**
- `Enable LLM Refinement` — Master toggle for LLM refinement and error correction. When disabled, configuration fields below are grayed out
- `Provider` — Provider dropdown with DeepSeek (`deepseek-v4-flash`), OpenRouter (`qwen/qwen3.5-9b`), and SiliconFlow (`Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B`) presets; selecting one auto-fills the fields below
- `API Base URL` — Provider API address (auto-filled by presets)
- `API Key` — API key, stored encrypted with DPAPI in local config
- `Model` — Model name (e.g., `deepseek-v4-flash`)
- `Extra Params` — Additional JSON object fields merged into the request body; outer braces are optional. Values are saved independently for each provider, and malformed merged JSON is rejected before network I/O
- A malformed legacy provider store is preserved byte-for-byte during Save instead
  of being reset and silently deleting unrelated provider entries.
- `[+]` / `[−]` — Add/delete custom providers (presets cannot be deleted)
- `Prompt` — Preset dropdown (`Basic Fix`, `Deep Fix`, `Polish`, `Custom`) + `[Manage...]` button. Clicking `[Manage...]` opens the modal System Prompt Management dialog with a spacious multiline editor, preset descriptions, and reset button
- `Test Connection` — Sends the same provider parameters as real correction and reports the result in the Status area below
- `Log refine before/after` & `Open Log Folder` — Records raw ASR and refined text to `llm_refine_YYYYMMDD.log` for debugging; the button opens the log directory directly in Explorer

**Vocabulary tab**
- Universal custom vocabulary shared across Qwen and Volcano Engine
- `Edit in External Editor` — Opens `vocabulary.json` in default text editor
- `Reload from File` — Reloads vocabulary from file
- `Format JSON` — Formats and indents the JSON text
- `Open Folder` — Opens the directory containing `vocabulary.json` in Windows Explorer

**Speech Engine tab — cloud backends**
- Each cloud backend is configured in place on the Speech Engine tab as soon as it is selected as `ASR Backend`; `Test Connection` sits in the same panel as the credentials it tests.
- **Baidu Cloud**: `API Key` / `Secret Key` (DPAPI encrypted) + `Language Model` (Mandarin/English/Cantonese/Sichuanese) + `Test Connection`
- **Volcano Engine (Doubao)**: `API Key` (DPAPI encrypted) + `ASR Mode` + `Model Version` + `Language` + `[Advanced...]` + `Test Connection`
  - ASR Mode: `bigmodel_nostream` (recommended, highest accuracy) / `bigmodel_async` (best latency) / `bigmodel` (real-time partial)
  - Model Version: `Seed-ASR 2.0 (duration)` / `Seed-ASR 2.0 (concurrent)` / `BigASR 1.0 (duration)` / `BigASR 1.0 (concurrent)`
  - `[Advanced...]` (810×800) groups the low-frequency tuning: Hotwords ID/Name and Correct-table ID/Name from the self-learning platform, `Enable history context` + history turns, `end_window_size`, `force_to_speech_time`, the `enable_ddc` / `enable_nonstream` / `enable_poi_fc` / `enable_music_fc` protocol switches, and the free-form Extra Params JSON editor.
  - `Use focused input field text as context` — Reads current input field text as ASR context (UIA/MSAA/WM_GETTEXT layered fallback, input field priority, history fallback)
  - `Reuse common vocabulary (vocabulary.json)` — Sends the shared Vocabulary tab word list with the request
- **Qwen ASR (DashScope)**: `API Key` (DPAPI encrypted) + model profile dropdown + profile-specific Endpoint + `Language` + `Chunk ms` + Audio 3 vocabulary/punctuation/VAD options + `Test Connection`
  - New installs default to `qwen-audio-3.0-asr-flash-streaming`; existing configurations preserve their selected model.
  - Audio 3 defaults use the configured Beijing Workspace domain; no region selector is exposed.
  - `qwen-audio-3.0-asr-flash-streaming` shows live partial text while recording; `qwen-audio-3.0-asr-flash` is intentionally final-only because it submits the complete WAV after release.
  - Turn detection is fixed to Manual for push-to-talk usage; Server VAD settings are intentionally hidden
- **MiMo ASR (Xiaomi)**: `API Key` (DPAPI encrypted) + `Base URL` + `Model` + `Language` + `Test Connection`
  - Default Base URL: `https://token-plan-ams.xiaomimimo.com/v1`
  - Default model: `mimo-v2.5-asr`; audio is uploaded as WAV via `/chat/completions`
- **Microsoft MAI Transcribe 2**: choose `OpenRouter` or `Azure Speech API`, keep both credentials independently DPAPI-encrypted, select `Auto` / Chinese / English / Cantonese, and test the currently selected API. OpenRouter uses `microsoft/mai-transcribe-2`; Azure Fast Transcription uses `MAI-Transcribe-2`. Both upload the complete WAV after release and return final text only; partial transcription is not supported.
- **Doubao IME (Free)**: no API key field. The experimental provider registers a Doubao IME-style device, stores device credentials with DPAPI-encrypted token, encodes PCM to Opus, and uses the unofficial `frontier-audio-ime-ws.doubao.com` WebSocket protocol. Availability and terms are not guaranteed.
  - Doubao IME bypasses local VAD and relies on the IME service's own segmentation. Partial HUD updates and final text are accumulated across cloud-side segments during one hotkey hold, so long recordings are pasted as one combined result after release. When selected as Fallback, Doubao IME replays the same raw PCM through a recorded request and writes refreshed credentials back to the saved config.
  - Streaming partial HUD for Qwen, Qwen IME Free, Volcano Engine, and Doubao IME is display-only clear-page: it shows live text within three body lines, then clears previous HUD text and restarts from the current last sentence; the new page keeps accumulating until it exceeds three body lines again, while the final paste text stays complete.
  - Diagnostic probe: run `.\tools\doubao_ime_probe.bat` to compile a small console probe that reuses saved Doubao IME credentials when available, performs a live protocol check, and when the bundled sample wav exists, performs a real speech recognition check. Add `--streaming` to send WAV frames with a live drain thread and validate partial/final streaming behavior; add `--fresh` to force temporary re-registration.
- **Qwen IME (Free)**: no API key field. Replays the reverse-engineered Qianwen IME protocol while VoxType captures WASAPI audio locally. Authentication uses the native signer from an explicitly verified `unet.dll`; unknown DLL fingerprints are rejected instead of calling version-dependent RVAs or sending a known-invalid HMAC fallback. UTDID is acquired from the local Qianwen IME cache/registry, and a configured debug override is stored with Windows DPAPI. Optional bundled LLM post-processing (`VoiceInputWrite`) replays the Qianwen IME HTTP endpoint. The current runtime still requires compatible Qianwen IME components; if initialization fails, the normal fallback ASR policy applies. Availability and terms are not guaranteed.
  - When selected as Fallback, Qwen IME Free is replayed through its native streaming session with the same recorded PCM; it is not treated as a local batch backend.
  - `Shell install path override` — optional manual override of the Qianwen IME install directory (auto-detected from `C:\Program Files\QianwenIME` by default).
  - A UTDID override remains a config-only diagnostic escape hatch; it is not exposed as a normal Settings field and is DPAPI-encrypted when persisted.
  - `Test Connection` checks UTDID acquisition and the ASR WebSocket handshake; when bundled post-processing is enabled, it also sends a small LLM probe and reports LLM failure separately.
  - `Polish (auto)` is the single switch for the bundled `VoiceInputWrite` post-processing path. `Punctuation included` and `Correction included` are read-only indicators because the original endpoint returns them in the same response, not as independent HTTP requests. The experimental `Rewrite selection` code path is retained for protocol research, but is currently disabled in Settings and forcibly turned off during config load/save. Its request-field mapping remains compatibility-derived and requires matching original-client request/response evidence before it can be enabled as a supported feature.
  - `Debug log` enables local Qwen protocol diagnostics; it does not change the recognition result.
- Cloud ASR backends handle recognition remotely; when VAD is enabled, Qwen and Volcano Engine use local streaming VAD trim, batch cloud backends use batch VAD trim before upload, and Qwen IME Free/Doubao IME upload full raw PCM/Opus without local VAD because their services perform segmentation. Local punctuation models are still bypassed for cloud backends

**Audio & Advanced tab**
- `Enable VAD` — Enable voice activity detection, checks for speech before recording, skips ASR when no voice detected to save time. VAD parameters (`Threshold`, `Min silence`, `Min speech`, `Pad start`, `Smooth win`) live here as well, so the Recognition tab stays free of acoustic tuning.
- `VAD model` — Voice activity detection model (requires Enable VAD):
  - `Silero VAD` — Lightweight and fast, accuracy F1 95.95
  - `FireRed VAD` — High precision (F1 97.57, false alarm rate 2.69%), model only 2.2MB. `Pad start` and `Smooth win` only apply to this model.
- `Recording diagnostics` is a shared capture service for every Local and cloud
  ASR backend, including provider retry and configured fallback stages:
  - `Off` (default) never saves diagnostic audio.
  - `Failures only` saves substantive no-speech, capture, transport, timeout,
    and contradictory-stage failures.
  - If every capture backend fails before the first PCM sample, VoxType saves a
    JSON-only manifest with the attempted backends, terminal phase/error code,
    and available device/format metadata; it does not create a fake empty WAV.
  - `All recordings` explicitly saves every utterance and shows a privacy warning.
  - `Open recordings folder` creates and opens the managed directory immediately;
    `Delete saved recordings...` asks for confirmation and preserves unknown files.
  - Installed builds use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VoxType\diagnostics\audio`; Portable
    builds use `<portable-root>\diagnostics\audio`. Files stay on this PC and
    are limited to 20 groups, 100 MiB, and 7 days.

**Diagnostic audio replay**
- `capture.wav` and deduplicated `inputNN.wav` artifacts are canonical 16 kHz,
  mono, PCM16 files. Their JSON manifest contains device/capture metrics,
  hashes, VAD metadata, stage kinds, retry/fallback reasons, and provider
  terminals, but not transcript, input context, API keys, tokens, or raw provider JSON.
- Replay locally without uploading audio:
  `.\tools\asr_audio_replay.bat --wav "<file.wav>" --backend local`
- Compare selected configured backends by repeating `--backend`, or use
  `--all-configured`. Selecting a cloud backend explicitly uploads that WAV.
  Streaming backends use real-time 20 ms cadence unless `--fast` is supplied.
  Transcript output is console-only and opt-in through `--show-text`.
- The BAT wrapper resolves DLLs, bundled VAD assets, and Portable configuration
  from the canonical runtime payload; direct tool runs may use
  `--runtime-dir <path>` explicitly. Quoted WAV/runtime paths containing `!` are
  preserved by the wrapper.
